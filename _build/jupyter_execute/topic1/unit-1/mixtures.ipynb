    "## Definition of a Mixture\n",
    "**Mixture:** **Two or more substances** (elements or compounds) that are **not chemically bonded** together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each substance in a mixture keeps its own properties, and they can be present in **variable proportions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "- Mixtures do **not** have a fixed composition (for example, air is a mixture of gases in varying amounts).\n",
    "- The components of a mixture can often be **separated by physical means** rather than chemical reactions.\n",
    "- Mixtures can be made from elements, compounds, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exam Reminder\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "In **AQA GCSE Chemistry**, remember that **mixtures** differ from **compounds** because their components are **not** chemically bonded. This means **no** new substance is formed when you create a mixture.\n"
