This textbook will follow the AQA GCSE Chemistry Higher Tier specification. Certain aspects of this book will be directly applicable
to other exam boards as the underlying Chemistry remains the same across exam boards. With regards to AQA, the [specification document](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/chemistry/gcse/chemistry-8462/specification/specification-at-a-glance)
can be downloaded as a PDF for reference.

For reference, this textbook is designed as a resource to be used alongside the taught PowerPoint presentations rather than a standalone resource, however, content has been fleshed out in as much detail as possible.

In all pages, the specification point(s) being covered are highlighted at the top as follows:

`````{admonition} Specification Point
:class: note
4.1.1.1 Atoms, Elements and Compounds
`````
**Bug:** If you are viewing the textbook in dark mode, the 3D compound visualiser has a frustrating grey border around the output. I have not managed to fix this and will do so if the solution is found.
